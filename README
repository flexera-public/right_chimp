Chimp: a command-line tool for remote command execution using the RightScale platform

The goal of the Chimp is to provide a simple command line utility for
performing bulk operations on servers managed on the RightScale platform.

INSTALLATION
------------
Installation and authentication instructions are available [here](INSTALLATION)

EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------

Run a RightScript on every server with a given tag:

  chimp --tag="service:myservice=true" --script="My RightScript"

Run a RightScript on every server in an array:

  chimp --array=moo1:replicant81 --script='APP Rainbows'

Run a shell command on servers with a specific tag:

  chimp --tag="service:myservice=true" --ssh="uptime"

Run a report:

  bin/chimp --tag="service:myservice=true" --report="nickname,ip-address,tag=myservice:version"

REPORTING
---------

Via the --report command line option it's possible to generate a CSV
report. Multiple fields to include in a report can be specified in a comma
delimited list:

  chimp --report="nickname,ip-address,tag=myservice:version" --array="MyAppServers"

Would include both the server nickname and ip address to the report as well as the specified tag:
